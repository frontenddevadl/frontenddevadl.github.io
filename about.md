We're a collection of front-end and full-stack developers based in Adelaide, Australia. We meet every 2-3 months to catch up and share experiences! Covering Vue.js, React, Angular, and more.

The Front-End Developers Adelaide meetup is organised by [Shane][shane], [Dan][dan] and [Mathew][mathew].

If you wish to contact the group, rather than an individual, create a new discussion [on Meetup][meetup].

We hope to see you at the next event!
